The continuation of the [old Wordpress blog](http://miroadamy.wordpress.com) with more agreeable tools: Github Wiki + Gollum, Markdown and Git.

My old blog at Miro's World has been kinda neglected in last two years. I have written several entries and published them only internally. I have decided now to pull those of the entries that do not contain customer references, code or customer IP out.
